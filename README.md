# Roll-Select
This is my first mini Mac OS app

WOW
===
This is my `first` Mac OS app. I like it!

#let's talk about it
## background
  I'll give a class to my class teacher in high school. I like Mac, I like Apple, I want to creat an application to
show my love, so this app is created.
## function
  This app can select randomly in a roll. Yes, a roll. But, I haven't have their roll until now. Therefore, I select
their postion.
## how to use it
  If you click the button named "开始随机" (start select randomly), a string will show in the second lable. If you have clicked the button, 
and you want choose next one, you can click the button "重置" (reset), and the string in the second lable will "go to"
the first lable. Then click "开始随机".
